This project uses Gooogle Cloud Compute Engine following the instructions here:

We used the Provided Disk Images with the following setups and softwares:

 - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 40 GB disks
 - Virtual environments for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. The environments are found at /home/dfd/env27/ and /home/dfd/env35/ respectively.
    - gdal
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - scikit-learn
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - (CPU-only) tensorflow (r1.3)
    - (GPU) tensorflow-gpu (r1.3)
 - (GPU) CUDA Toolkit 8.0 and cuDNN v6

To use the disks, you first need to create your own custom image using our file, and use this custom image as the boot disk for your new VM instance.

In the sidebar, go to Compute Engine, then Images. Click on the blue CREATE IMAGE button at the top. Enter your preferred name in the Name field, such as “dfd-gpu-image”. Under Source, select Cloud Storage file.

Under Cloud Storage file, enter one of the following:
dfd-bucket/dfd_cpu_image.tar.gz (for the CPU-only instance)
dfd-bucket/dfd_gpu_image.tar.gz (for the GPU instance)

Click on the blue Create button. It will take several minutes for your image to be created (about 10-15 minutes in our experience).

### Running Code on a VM Instance ###

If you use our provided disk images, the VMs will already have a user named dfd. The virtual environments are located at /home/dfd/env27/ and /home/dfd/env35/ for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, respectively.

Activate the virtual environment for the version of Python you want to work with. For example
source /home/dfd/env35/bin/activate
